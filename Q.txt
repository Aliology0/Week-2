1- What are the different types of constructors in object-oriented programming? Explain each type briefly.

1)Default Constructor: It is a constructor that takes no arguments and it sets default values for the variables.
2)Parameterized Constructor: It is a constructor that takes arguments that initialize the variables with specific values.
3)Copy Constructor: It is a constructor used to create a new object as an exact copy of another object's values.

2- What is a destructor? When is it invoked in a program?

A destructor is a special member function that is invoked automatically when an object
goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed using delete or delete[].

Its primary purpose is to free resources, such as memory allocated on the heap.

If you don't define a destructor, the compiler provides a default one, and for some classes this is sufficient.

3- What is a static class or static member? How is it different from an instance member?

A static class or static member belongs to the class itself not the object so most of the times
the static member is shared among the class objects.

While instance members are tied to a specific object of a class so that every object
has its own values and these values won't be shared with other objects.
